'development' : 'production',\n  devServer: {\n    hot: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using <code>webpack-hot-middleware</code></summary>\n<br />\n\n```js\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using <code>webpack-plugin-serve</code></summary>\n<br />\n\n```js\nconst { WebpackPluginServe } = require('webpack-plugin-serve');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ? 'development' : 'production',\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new WebpackPluginServe()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n</details>\n\nThen, add the `react-refresh/babel` plugin to your Babel configuration and this plugin to your Webpack configuration.\n\n```js\nconst ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin = require('@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin');\n\nconst isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: isDevelopment ?

require.resolve('swc-loader'),\n            options: {\n              jsc: {\n                transform: {\n                  react: {\n                    development: isDevelopment,\n                    refresh: isDevelopment,\n                  },\n                },\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  plugins: [isDevelopment && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()].filter(Boolean),\n};\n```\n\n> Starting from version `0.1.13`, `swc-loader` will set the `development` option based on Webpack's `mode` option.\n> `swc` won't enable fast refresh when `development` is `false`.\n\n</details>\n\nFor more information on how to set up \"Fast Refresh\" with different integrations,\nplease check out [our examples](examples).\n\n### Overlay Integration\n\nThis plugin integrates with the most common Webpack HMR solutions to surface errors during development -\nin the form of an error overlay.\n\nBy default, `webpack-dev-server` is used,\nbut you can set the [`overlay.sockIntegration`](docs/API.md#sockintegration) option to match what you're using.\n\nThe supported versions are as follows:\n\n| Dependency               | Version           |\n| ------------------------ | ----------------- |\n| `webpack-dev-server`     | `4.8.0`+ or `5.x` |\n| `webpack-hot-middleware` | `2.x`             |\n| `webpack-plugin-serve`   | `1.x`             |\n\n## API\n\nPlease refer to [the API docs](docs/API.md) for all available options.\n\n## FAQs and Troubleshooting\n\nPlease refer to [the Troubleshooting guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for FAQs and resolutions to common issues.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT License](/LICENSE).\n\n## Special Thanks\n\n<a
