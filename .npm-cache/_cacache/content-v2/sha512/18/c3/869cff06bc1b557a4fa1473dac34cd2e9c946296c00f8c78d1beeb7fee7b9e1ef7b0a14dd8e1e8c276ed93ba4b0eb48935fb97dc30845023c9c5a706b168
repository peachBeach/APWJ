This allows them to work in ES3 environments\nlike IE6, but it's also overkill; almost no one supports IE6 anymore.\n\nI'd rather not ship tons of extra code to website visitors. A polyfill for this\nfeature can be implemented in a few short lines of code using modern language\nfeatures. That's what `fromentries` (this package) does.\n\nThis means that `fromentries` only works in evergreen browsers like:\n\n- Chrome\n- Firefox\n- Edge\n- Safari\n- Opera\n\nIt does not work in browsers like IE11 and older (unless you transpile it first).\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst fromEntries = require('fromentries')\n\nconst map = new Map([ [ 'a', 1 ], [ 'b', 2 ], [ 'c', 3 ] ])\nconst obj = fromEntries(map)\nconstole.log(obj) // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n\nconst searchParams = new URLSearchParams('foo=bar&baz=qux')\nconst obj2 = fromEntries(searchParams)\nconsole.log(obj2) // { foo: 'bar', 'baz': 'qux' }\n```\n\n## What is a ponyfill?\n\n> A *ponyfill* is almost the same as a polyfill, but not quite. Instead of\n> patching functionality for older browsers, a ponyfill provides that\n> functionality as a standalone module you can use.\n\nRead more at [PonyFoo](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/polyfills-or-ponyfills).\n\n## See also\n\n- [TC39 proposal for Object.fromEntries](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-from-entries)\n\n## License\n\nMIT.
