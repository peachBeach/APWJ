If `values` is an object, iterations are started in order by the order returned by `Object.keys` (order is not guaranteed).\n\nIf `values` is an array, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an array. If `values` is an object, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an object with corresponding keys.\n\n#### `iterator(value, key, done)`\n\nAn async function called per iteration. All iterations are run in parallel.\n\nThe `iterator` function is called once with each `value`, `key` and a function (`done(error, result)`) to call when the async work is complete.\n\nIf `done` is passed an error as the first argument, the iteration will fail and the sequence will be ended; however, any iterations in progress will still complete. If `done` is passed a `result` value as the second argument, it will be added to the final results array or object.\n\n#### `options`\n\nThe `options` object is primarily used for specifying functions that give insight into the lifecycle of each iteration. The possible extension points are `create`, `before`, `after` and `error`. If an extension point is not specified, it defaults to a no-op function.\n\nThe `options` object for `map` also allows specifying `concurrency` in which to run your iterations. By default, your iterations will run at maximum concurrency.\n\n##### `options.concurrency`\n\nLimits the amount of iterations allowed to run at a given time.\n\n##### `options.create(value, key)`\n\nCalled at the very beginning of each iteration with the `value` being iterated and the `key` from the array or object. If `create` returns a value (`storage`), it is passed to the `before`, `after` and `error` extension points.\n\nIf a value is not returned, an empty object is used as `storage` for each other extension point.\n\nThis is useful for tracking information across an iteration.\n\n##### `options.before(storage)`\n\nCalled immediately before each iteration with the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `options.after(result, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after each iteration with the `result` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `options.error(error, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after a failed iteration with the `error` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n#### `callback(error, results)`\n\nA function that is called after all iterations have completed or one iteration has errored.\n\nIf all iterations completed successfully, the `error` argument will be empty and the `results` will be a mapping of the `iterator` results.\n\nIf an iteration errored, the `error` argument will be passed from that iteration and the `results` will be whatever partial results had completed successfully before the error occurred.\n\n### `mapSeries(values, iterator[, options][, callback])`\n\nTakes an object or array of `values` and an `iterator` function to execute with each value.\nOptionally, takes an `options` object and a `callback` function that is called upon completion of the iterations.\n\nAll iterations run in serial.\n\n#### `values`\n\nAn array or object of values to iterate over.\n\nIf `values` is an array, iterations are started in order by index. If `values` is an object, iterations are started in order by the order returned by `Object.keys` (order is not guaranteed).\n\nIf `values` is an array, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an array. If `values` is an object, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an object with corresponding keys.\n\n#### `iterator(value, key, done)`\n\nAn async function called per iteration. All iterations are run in serial.\n\nThe `iterator` function is called once with each `value`, `key` and a function (`done(error, result)`) to call when the async work is complete.\n\nIf `done` is passed an error as the first argument, the iteration will fail and the sequence will be ended without executing any more iterations. If `done` is passed a `result` value as the second argument, it will be added to the final results array or object.\n\n#### `options`\n\nThe `options` object is primarily used for specifying functions that give insight into the lifecycle of each iteration. The possible extension points are `create`, `before`, `after` and `error`. If an extension point is not specified, it defaults to a no-op function.\n\n##### `options.create(value, key)`\n\nCalled at the very beginning of each iteration with the `value` being iterated and the `key` from the array or object. If `create` returns a value (`storage`), it is passed to the `before`, `after` and `error` extension points.\n\nIf a value is not returned, an empty object is used as `storage` for each other extension point.\n\nThis is useful for tracking information across an iteration.\n\n##### `options.before(storage)`\n\nCalled immediately before each iteration with the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `options.after(result, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after each iteration with the `result` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `options.error(error, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after a failed iteration with the `error` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n#### `callback(error, results)`\n\nA function that is called after all iterations have completed or one iteration has errored.\n\nIf all iterations completed successfully, the `error` argument will be empty and the `results` will be a mapping of the `iterator` results.\n\nIf an iteration errored, the `error` argument will be passed from that iteration and the `results` will be whatever partial results had completed successfully before the error occurred.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[downloads-image]:
