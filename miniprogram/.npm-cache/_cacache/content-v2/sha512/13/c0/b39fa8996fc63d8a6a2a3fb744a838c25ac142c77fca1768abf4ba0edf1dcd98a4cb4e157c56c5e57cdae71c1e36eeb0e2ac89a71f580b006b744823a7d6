It is a separate package because it has\ndifferent semantics:\n\n1. It does not call `.resume()` on streams2+ streams. streams2 streams monkeypatch `.pipe`\nwhen entering flowing mode; avoiding `resume()` avoids that fate.\n2. It does not examine `._readableState`; instead it checks for the presence of `._read`.\n\n## API\n\n### exhaust(Stream s) -> Stream s\n\nTakes a stream, `s`, and returns it. Ensures that the stream is flowing, either by calling\n`.resume()` if the stream is a streams1 stream, or by piping it to a \"black hole\" stream that\ncontinually asks for more data.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T13:26:07.037Z","modified":"2023-04-03T02:06:33.379Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-19T00:43:31.174Z","1.0.2":"2017-08-30T06:13:54.801Z","1.0.0":"2014-08-22T07:01:51.090Z"},"versions":{"1.0.1":{"name":"stream-exhaust","version":"1.0.1","description":"Ensure that a stream is flowing data without mutating it","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"node test.js"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"author":{"name":"Chris Dickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git","devDependencies":{"readable-stream":"^1.0.31","tape":"^2.14.0","through2":"^0.5.1"},"gitHead":"41f9415b2e1885994badb08e9e4c628c17d74a69","_id":"stream-exhaust@1.0.1","_shasum":"c0c4455e54ce5a179ca8736e73334b4e7fd67553","_from":".","_npmVersion":"2.1.9","_nodeVersion":"0.10.34","_npmUser":{"name":"chrisdickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"},"maintainers":[{"name":"chrisdickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"}],"dist":{"shasum":"c0c4455e54ce5a179ca8736e73334b4e7fd67553","size":1967,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/stream-exhaust/-/stream-exhaust-1.0.1.tgz","integrity":"sha512-E6KFlI/xwax57rI1eZ3ewqsbR4fxAE3A2BdoK01Etb2ekWzx4xSl6swCgZvSP7Y8LMdwIh9Fx9uByD+Rcht2ag=="},"directories":{},"publish_time":1421628211174,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1421628211174,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-13T18:02:31.751Z"},"1.0.2":{"name":"stream-exhaust","version":"1.0.2","description":"Ensure that a stream is flowing data without mutating it","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"node test.js"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"author":{"name":"Chris Dickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git","devDependencies":{"readable-stream":"^1.0.31","tape":"^2.14.0","through2":"^0.5.1"},"gitHead":"3142d2e2ac0eb301d561ddf501407fbd75ebb1ee","_id":"stream-exhaust@1.0.2","_npmVersion":"5.3.0","_nodeVersion":"8.3.0","_npmUser":{"name":"chrisdickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"},"dist":{"shasum":"acdac8da59ef2bc1e17a2c0ccf6c320d120e555d","size":1983,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/stream-exhaust/-/stream-exhaust-1.0.2.tgz","integrity":"sha512-b/qaq/GlBK5xaq1yrK9/zFcyRSTNxmcZwFLGSTG0mXgZl/4Z6GgiyYOXOvY7N3eEvFRAG1bkDRz5EPGSvPYQlw=="},"maintainers":[{"name":"chrisdickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"}],"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/stream-exhaust-1.0.2.tgz_1504073634663_0.6293191735167056"},"directories":{},"publish_time":1504073634801,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1504073634801,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-13T18:02:31.499Z"},"1.0.0":{"name":"stream-exhaust","version":"1.0.0","description":"Ensure that a stream is flowing data without mutating it","main":"index.js","scripts":{"test":"node test.js"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"author":{"name":"Chris Dickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"},"license":"MIT","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git","devDependencies":{"readable-stream":"^1.0.31","tape":"^2.14.0","through2":"^0.5.1"},"gitHead":"5bb7a07afa475076a3177872096488f4363fdc16","_id":"stream-exhaust@1.0.0","_shasum":"edc3579ea69ed9050360a9ced8e9f9e6a18fe70d","_from":".","_npmVersion":"1.4.14","_npmUser":{"name":"chrisdickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"},"maintainers":[{"name":"chrisdickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"}],"dist":{"shasum":"edc3579ea69ed9050360a9ced8e9f9e6a18fe70d","size":1910,"noattachment":false,"tarball":"https://registry.npmmirror.com/stream-exhaust/-/stream-exhaust-1.0.0.tgz","integrity":"sha512-9u4ShDMHmGdKC7E8h+Mv8gPWnMsnkDx3CapmRdS60l5Bzue9S/PmS4aY3UJILS1GXZROHxnhGHLmh2b2SEvNIg=="},"directories":{},"publish_time":1408690911090,"_hasShrinkwrap":false,"_cnpm_publish_time":1408690911090,"_cnpmcore_publish_time":"2021-12-13T18:02:31.931Z"}},"_source_registry_name":"default"}
