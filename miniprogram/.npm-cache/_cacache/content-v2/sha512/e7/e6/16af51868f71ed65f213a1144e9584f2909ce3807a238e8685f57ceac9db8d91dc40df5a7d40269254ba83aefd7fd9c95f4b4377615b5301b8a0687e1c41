It attempts to parse an inline sourcemap or load an external sourcemap for the file. If a valid sourcemap is found, the `sources` & `sourcesContent` properties are resolved to actual files (if possible) and a fully resolved sourcemap is attached as `file.sourceMap`. If a sourcemap is not found, a stub sourcemap is generated for the file and attached as `file.sourceMap`.\n\nOnce all resolution is complete, the `callback(err, updatedFile)` is called with the `updatedFile`. If an error occurs, it will be passed as `err` and `updatedFile` will be undefined. **Note:** The original file is mutated but `updatedFile` is passed to the callback as a convenience.\n\nIf the `file` is not a Vinyl object or the contents are streaming, an Error will be passed to the `callback`.\n\nIf the `file` has a `.sourceMap` property or the contents are null, the `callback` will be called immediately without mutation to the file.\n\nAll filesystem operations are optional & non-fatal so any errors will not be bubbled to the `callback`.\n\n### `sourcemap.write(file, [outputPath,] callback)`\n\nTakes a [Vinyl][vinyl] `file` object, (optionally) an `outputPath` string and a `callback` function.\n\nIf `outputPath` is not passed, an inline sourcemap will be generated from the `file.sourceMap` property and appended to the `file.contents`. Once the inline sourcemap is appended, the `callback(err, updatedFile)` is called with the `updatedFile`. If an error occurs, it will be passed as `err` and `updatedFile` will be undefined. **Note:** The original file is mutated but `updatedFile` is passed to the callback as a convenience.\n\nIf `outputPath` is passed, a new Vinyl file will be generated using `file.cwd` and `file.base` from the original file, the path to the external sourcemap, and the `file.sourceMap` (as contents). The external location will be appended to the `file.contents` of the original file. Once the new file is created and location appended, the `callback(err, updatedFile, sourcemapFile)` is called with the `updatedFile` and the `sourcemapFile`. If an error occurs, it will be passed as `err` and `updatedFile`/`sourcemapFile` will be undefined. **Note:** The original file is mutated but `updatedFile` is passed to the callback as a convenience.\n\nIf the `file` is not a Vinyl object or the contents are streaming, an Error will be passed to the `callback`.\n\nIf the `file` doesn't have a `.sourceMap` property or the contents are null, the `callback` will be called immediately without mutation to the file.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n[downloads-image]:
